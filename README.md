# Moran

Moran is a minimalist, typography-centric design ideal for long-form writing.

## How it works?

We used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a lovely static generator in Ruby, to create this theme.

## First steps

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/downloads/), in case you don't have them yet.

2. Once installed these dependencies, open up the terminal and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the following command:

```sh
$ gem install jekyll --no-ri --no-doc
```

3. Now clone the project:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:randsonjs/moran.git
```

4. Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
$ cd moran
```

5. And finally run:

```sh
$ jekyll server --watch
```

You'll have access to the website at `localhost:4000` :D
